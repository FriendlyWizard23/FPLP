Put into a list, called alkaline_earth_metals, the atomic numbers of the six alkaline earth metals: beryllium (4), magnesium (12), calcium (20), strontium (38), barium (56), and radium (88). Then

Write a function that returns the highest atomic number in alkaline_earth_metals.
Write a function that sorts alkaline_earth_metals in ascending order (from the lightest to the heaviest).
Put into a second list, called noble_gases, the noble gases: helium (2), neon (10), argon (18), krypton (36), xenon (54), and radon (86). Then

Write a function (or a group of functions) that merges the two lists and print the result as couples (name, atomic number) sorted in ascending order on the element names.
