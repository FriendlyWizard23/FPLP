23. Extract a given number of randomly selected elements from a list. (medium)
The selected items shall be returned in a list. We use the Random module but do not initialize it with Random.self_init for reproducibility.

# rand_select ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"; "e"; "f"; "g"; "h"] 3;;
- : string list = ["g"; "d"; "a"]
